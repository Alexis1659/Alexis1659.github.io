  	<h1>Chihuahua Breed</h1>
  	<p>Chihuahuas descend from the <b>Techichi dog</b>, an ancient dog. These dogs were originally bred for <b>companionship, religious ceremonies and rituals, and food</b>. There is also evidence of these dogs being used for <b>war</b>, Aztecs bringing thousands of them into battle to forage land in front before the Aztecs would conquer it. </p>
